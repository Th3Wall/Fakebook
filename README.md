# Fakebook
> This is a Facebook-clone project created with the purpose of learning the fundamentals of React.js starting from a simple Create React App.

## üéØ About ##

I've started this project with the idea of practice the fundamentals of React.js starting from a really simple [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I have re-built the brand new Facebook web interface structuring the project in small React components.
The build has a built-in Google Authentication, so you require a Google account in order to be able to sign in and see the complete dashboard.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Demo ##

Here's the [demo link](https://fakebook-8b087.web.app/).
